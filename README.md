# Super Simple Stocks
Super simple stocks is an application to manage trades on a set of stocks and it's a technical test as part of 
the hiring process for a very important company.

### 1. Assignment Description

#####Â Requirements

1.	Provide working source code that will:

    a.	For a given stock:
    
        i.    Calculate the dividend yield.
        ii.   Calculate the P/E Ratio.
        iii.  Record a trade, with timestamp, quantity of shares, buy or sell indicator and price.
        iv.   Calculate Stock Price based on trades recorded in past 15 minutes.

    b.	Calculate the GBCE All Share Index using the geometric mean of prices for all stocks

##### Constraints & Notes

1.	Written in one of these languages:
    
    * Java, C#, C++, Python.
    
2.	No database or GUI is required, all data need only be held in memory.

3.	Formulas and data provided are simplified representations for the purpose of this exercise.


### 2. Solution

##### Architecture and Assumptions

In a _**S**ervice **O**riented **A**rchitecture (**SOA**)_, a software application is designed 
by defining components, which provides services to other components in other applications. Typically, 
those services are available to be consumed using a network through some specifics communication 
protocols. By definition a _**service**_ is a self-contained component, which offer a specific 
functionality and could be designed to perform one or more operations. This make possible reuse 
code just changing the way the service interoperates with other services.

Following the SOA approach, the solution for the assignment is designed to provide the service 
_**SimpleStockService**_, which has operations to calculate the dividend yield, P/E Ratio, 
Stock Price and record trades for a given stock. Besides, the service provides an operation 
to calculate the GBCE All Share Index for all stocks supported by the Super Simple Stocks application. 
Providing this service, all the requirements of the assignment are met.

Responding to one of the constraints, the implementation of the solution is written in JAVA 
language using Apache MAVEN as a software project management tool and Spring Framework. 
As it is widely known by the JAVA developer community, MAVEN 
provides some powerful features in software development, someone of them as: 
A easy and flexible way to build all artifacts in the project, generates quality reports, 
execution and reporting of unit test, support for continuous integration development, etc.

Spring give a powerful pattern as Inversion of Control, which allows us to have a cleaner code, 
aspect oriented programming AoP, etc. Although, Spring is used mainly as object container, 
for example to inject the information of the stocks supported by the application and to configure 
the data for the unit test, include other features of spring in the application is an straightforward 
task. Enable the use of annotations, scan spring components in the code and place holder for 
the properties are already done.

Although the approach is SOA, the implementation of the service is built as _**java library**_ as
a jar artifact named _**super-simple-stock-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar**_. Because there are no explicit 
integration requirements, the simplest decision was to create a java library, which could be 
integrated in all the JAVA technologies. We don't know if the requirements are oriented to integrate 
the functionality within an existing web application just to complete the app, or they are intended to 
be published as web services to be consumed by external systems or they will be integrated as part of 
a SOA services choreography in a more complex system.

The java library for this assignment is the more flexible solution with the current requirements. 
For example, when an integration need shows up, specifying that an external stock market system wants 
to know the information for the stocks in the Super Simple Stocks app. One option could be to publish 
the service in the library as a _**RESTful Web Service**_. 

The design of the library will allow us to respond to this requirement very fast. To build a RESTful web 
service in Spring, the HTTP requests should be handled by a resource controller. A resource controller 
is a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) identified by the **@RestController** annotation. 
Each operation in the web service should be mapped with a method in the controller, which is accomplished
using the **@RequestMapping** annotation. In the solution architecture, the resource controller class
should be added in the integration layer. The next snippet of code shows the resource controller to new 
integration requirement:

```java
package com.jpmorgan.stocks.simple.integration.ws.rest;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class SimpleStocServiceController {

    @RequestMapping("/calculateDividendYield")
    public calculateDividendYield(@RequestParam(value="stock", defaultValue="") String stockSymbol) {
		// Get the simple stcok service from the factory
		SimpleStockService simpleStockService = SimpleStockServicesFactory.INSTANCE.getSimpleStockService();
		
		// Delegates the work to the java library
		return simpleStockService.calculateDividendYield(stockSymbol);
    }
}
```
Quite simple. Related to deployment aspects, we should make some changes in the maven 
configuration if we want to generate a war file instead a jar, for example, but those changes
are small. So, with maven as project management tool we have many possibilities to generate 
all the artifacts, as we need it.
